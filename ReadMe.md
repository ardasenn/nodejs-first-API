### Hi everyone! Iâ€™ve developed my first Node.js API with Express.js, and Iâ€™m eager to become a MERN stack developer. ðŸ˜Š

### Before you start, make sure to update the connection string in your .env file. After that, youâ€™ll need to install the necessary Node modules.

Here are some key points about my project:

#### User Registration and Tokens:

- Users must register with their email and password.
- After register , they receive an access token and a refresh token for business logic.
- Note that only HTTP requests can use the refresh token via cookies.

#### Book Operations:

- You can add new books, update existing ones, and list books.
- However, book deletion is restricted to admin users.

### What I Learned from This Project:

- User Authentication with JWT in Node.js. Iâ€™ve implemented secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens.
- CRUD Operations with Mongoose.
- Custom Middleware. Iâ€™ve developed custom middleware to handle specific tasks within my application.
